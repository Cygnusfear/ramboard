# List view grouping — group by status, type, or epic

Add grouping to list view with three modes: group by status, group by type, group by epic. Visual style matches Linear — section header rows with label + count, collapsible. Epic grouping is special: the epic ticket IS the group header (clickable, shows full row data), and child resolution is transitive (walk deps/links graph up to nearest epic ancestor).



## Goal
Add a "Group by" option to list view that groups tickets under collapsible section headers. Three modes: status, type, epic. Epic grouping walks the deps/links graph transitively to resolve ancestry.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Group by status: sections for Open, In Progress, Closed, Cancelled with ticket count
- [ ] Group by type: sections for each type (Bug, Feature, Task, Epic, Chore)
- [ ] Group by epic: epic tickets become section headers (full row — clickable, status, priority, tags), child tickets nested under their ancestor epic
- [ ] Epic ancestry is transitive: if C→B→Epic, C appears under Epic
- [ ] Tickets with no epic ancestor go in 'Ungrouped' section
- [ ] Multiple epic ancestors: closest (shortest path) wins
- [ ] Collapse state persisted per-view
- [ ] Group header shows group label + ticket count
- [ ] Collapsible with chevron toggle
- [ ] Works with existing sort/filter — grouping applied after filter, sort within groups
- [ ] No grouping option (flat list) remains the default
- [ ] UI to select grouping mode (toolbar or view config)

## Verification
- [ ] Toggle group by status — see sections with correct counts
- [ ] Toggle group by type — see sections per type
- [ ] Toggle group by epic — epics become headers, children nested correctly
- [ ] Create chain: Epic → Ticket A → Ticket B, verify B appears under Epic
- [ ] Ticket with no epic link appears in Ungrouped
- [ ] Collapse a group, navigate away, come back — still collapsed
- [ ] Filter + group: filtered tickets still grouped correctly
- [ ] Sort within groups works
- [ ] Click epic header row — navigates to epic detail
- [ ] Performance: grouping 2000+ tickets stays snappy
