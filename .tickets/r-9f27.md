# Virtualize list view with TanStack Virtual

Add virtual scrolling to list view so only visible rows are in the DOM. Currently rendering 1000+ rows kills performance.



## Goal
Add virtual scrolling to list view so only visible rows are in the DOM. Currently rendering 1000+ rows kills performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Only ~30-50 rows in DOM at any time regardless of ticket count
- [ ] Smooth scrolling with no jank
- [ ] Drag-select still works across virtual rows
- [ ] Keyboard j/k still scrolls into view
- [ ] Row entrance animation still works for visible rows
- [ ] Selection state preserved during scroll

## Verification
- [ ] DOM inspector shows ~30-50 row elements with 1000+ tickets
- [ ] Smooth scroll through full list
- [ ] Drag-select works across viewport boundary

## Worktree
