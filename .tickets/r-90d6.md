# Fix infinite render loop — filteredTickets selector returns new ref each call

filteredTickets() called inside Zustand selectors creates new arrays on every subscription check, causing React 19 infinite re-renders. Fix by extracting to a memoized hook.



## Goal
filteredTickets() called inside Zustand selectors creates new arrays on every subscription check, causing React 19 infinite re-renders. Fix by extracting to a memoized hook.

- [ ] ListView, BoardView, HeaderBar all show filtered tickets correctly
- [ ] Sorting and filtering still work

## Verification
- [ ] App loads in browser without console errors
- [ ] Ticket list renders with data
