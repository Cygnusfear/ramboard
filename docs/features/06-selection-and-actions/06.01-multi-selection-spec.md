> **Feature Area:** [[../README|06-Selection-and-Actions]]
> **Feature ID:** 06.01

## Behavior

### Selection Mechanics (Linear model)

| Input | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Click row | Navigate to ticket detail (NOT select) |
| Checkbox click | Toggle selection (does not navigate) |
| `X` | Toggle selection on highlighted/focused row |
| `Shift + Click` | Range select from last selected to clicked |
| `Shift + Up/Down` | Extend selection by one row |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + A` | Select all visible (filtered) tickets |
| `Escape` | Clear all selections |

### Bulk Action Bar
Appears at bottom of viewport when 2+ tickets selected. Zinc-900 background, subtle top border.

Contents:
- Selection count ("3 selected")
- Status dropdown (apply to all)
- Priority dropdown (apply to all)
- Tags dropdown (add/remove)
- Close All button
- Clear selection (X icon)

### Write Behavior
Bulk actions call PATCH for each selected ticket sequentially. Shows progress ("Updating 3/7..."). On completion, selection is preserved (not cleared) so user can verify.

### Works in Both Views
Selection state is shared between list and board views. Switching views preserves selection.
