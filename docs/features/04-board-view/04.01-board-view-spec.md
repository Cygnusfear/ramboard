# 04.01 Board View

> **Feature Area:** [[../README|04-Board-View]]
> **Feature ID:** 04.01

## Behavior

### Layout
Horizontal columns, one per status: Open, In Progress, Closed, Cancelled. Each column has a header with status name and count. Columns are scrollable vertically, the board scrolls horizontally if needed.

### Card Contents
- Ticket ID (mono, muted)
- Title (2 lines max, truncated)
- Priority dot (colored)
- Tag pills (max 3, overflow as "+N")

### Drag and Drop
- Drag card between columns → PATCH status change → server runs `tk` command
- Drop animation: CSS transition for position, anime.js spring for settle
- Card shadow elevates during drag (Zinc-900 shadow)
- Drop target column highlights with subtle blue border

### Column Behavior
- Click column header → collapse/expand
- Collapsed column shows as narrow strip with count badge
- Column card order: same sort as list view (priority then date)

### Selection in Board
- `X` on focused card toggles selection
- Multi-select works across columns
- Bulk drag: drag any selected card, all selected cards move together

## Decisions

### ADR-1: @dnd-kit over react-beautiful-dnd
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** react-beautiful-dnd is unmaintained. @dnd-kit is actively maintained, lighter, better API.
- **Decision:** Use @dnd-kit/core + @dnd-kit/sortable.
