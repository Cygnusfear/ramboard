# 07.01 Vim Bindings & Command Palette

> **Feature Area:** [[../README|07-Keyboard-and-Vim]]
> **Feature ID:** 07.01

## Behavior

### Navigation (no mode switching — always active unless input focused)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Move highlight down/up |
| `g g` | Jump to first ticket |
| `G` | Jump to last ticket |
| `Ctrl+d` / `Ctrl+u` | Half-page down/up |
| `H` / `L` | Previous/next project |
| `1`-`9` | Jump to project by position |
| `/` or `Cmd+K` | Open command palette / focus search |
| `Enter` | Open highlighted ticket detail |
| `Escape` | Back / clear selection / close palette |

### Actions

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `x` | Toggle selection on highlighted ticket |
| `X` | Select range from anchor to current |
| `o` | Set status → Open |
| `i` | Set status → In Progress |
| `c` | Set status → Closed |
| `p` | Cycle priority |
| `v` | Toggle List / Board view |
| `?` | Show keyboard shortcut overlay |

### Command Palette (Cmd+K)
Modal overlay, centered, dark. Fuzzy search across ticket ID + title + tags in current project. Results update as you type. Enter to navigate. Supports action prefix:
- `>close t-f565` — close a ticket
- `>start t-f565` — start a ticket
- `>tag t-f565 critical` — add tag

### Implementation Note
Keybindings defined as data in `lib/keybindings.ts`. Hook `use-keyboard.ts` listens for keydown, checks if any input is focused (skip if so), matches against keymap, dispatches action to store.

`g g` is a two-key sequence — use a 300ms timeout for the second key.
