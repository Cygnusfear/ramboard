# Agent Instructions: docs/playbook

Purpose: process, tooling, and repo workflow documentation. Each entry is a SKILL.md (standard format understood by LLM agents).

Rules:
- Follow `/AGENTS.md` and `docs/AGENTS.md`.
- Use Johnny Decimal IDs for subfolders and directory prefixes (e.g., `10-02-build-pipeline/SKILL.md`).
- Keep instructions actionable and step-by-step.
- Update related links when moving or renaming playbook entries.
