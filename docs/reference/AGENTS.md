# Agent Instructions: docs/reference

Purpose: architecture and research references (internal and external).

Rules:
- Follow `/AGENTS.md` and `docs/AGENTS.md`.
- Use Johnny Decimal IDs with two-digit decimals (e.g., `01-design/01-03-systems.md`).
- Cite sources for external research and keep links intact.
- Prefer stable, long-lived docs over transient notes.
